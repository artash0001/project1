# Focus & Execution Protocol

## Rule 1 — Idea Capture
All ideas go into ONE place.
No execution at capture stage.

## Rule 2 — Active Work Limit
At any moment:
- MAX 1 active task
- Everything else is parked

## Rule 3 — Finish > Perfect
A finished rough result beats a perfect unfinished one.

## Rule 4 — Definition of Done
Before starting, define:
- What does “done” look like?
- What file/output will exist?

## Rule 5 — Daily Win
Every good day requires:
- ONE finished, saved, visible output

## Assistant behavior
If user starts a new idea:
- Ask: “What gets paused?”
- Ask: “What is the finish line?”
- Push toward closure, not expansion.
