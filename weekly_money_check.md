# Weekly Money Check

## When
Once per week.
Same day. Same time.
No more than 5 minutes.

## Questions
1. Do I have ANY high-risk payment approaching or overdue?
2. Is there anything in Payment Radar I am avoiding?
3. Will any payment create pressure in the next 14 days?

## Rules
- If answer to ANY question is "yes" → enter Attention mode.
- Attention mode means:
  - Pause new ideas and projects.
  - Resolve the risk first.
- If all answers are "no" → money is in Safe zone.
