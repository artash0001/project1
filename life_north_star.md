## Operational definition of a good day

A day is considered GOOD if:
- I had enough energy to work without forcing myself.
- I maintained focus for at least one uninterrupted block.
- I finished ONE concrete task and saved the result.
- My work chaos felt controlled, not overwhelming.
- I did not add new active tasks without finishing the current one.

A day is considered BAD if:
- I jumped between ideas without finishing anything.
- I felt constant mental noise and lack of control.
- I ended the day without a clear, finished output.
